The Qwiic ToF Imager - VL53L5CX is here! This little breakout board is built around ST Electronics' VL53L5CX; a state of the art, Time-of-Flight (ToF), multizone ranging sensor that uses a SPAD array, physical infrared filters, and diffractive optical elements (DOE) to achieve the best ranging performance in various ambient lighting conditions with a range of cover glass materials. Multizone distance measurements are possible up to 8x8 zones with a wide 63 Â° diagonal FoV which can be reduced by software. 

Ideal for 3D room mapping, obstacle detection for robotics, gesture recognition, IoT, laser-assisted autofocus, and AR/VR enhancement, the Qwiic connector on this sensor makes integration easy.
